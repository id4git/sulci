# scripts/

Developer tooling for sulci-oss. These scripts are not part of the published
package — they exist to help contributors run pre-commit / pre-release
verification more reliably than ad-hoc shell loops.

## What's here

| Script | Purpose | Typical wall-clock | API cost |
|---|---|---|---|
| `run_tests_per_file.py` | Run pytest test files one at a time, in fresh subprocesses | 10-15 min full sweep on M-series Mac | none |
| `run_examples.py` | Run every example + smoke test with timeout, capture pass/fail | 10-15 min full sweep on M-series Mac | none with mock fallback; small $ if API keys are set |
| `verify_integration_examples.py` | Verify langchain & llamaindex examples select the right LLM provider across 4 credential scenarios | 10-15 min for full 8-run matrix | $0.10-0.20 |
| `verify_benchmark.py` | Run the canonical TF-IDF benchmark and verify headline numbers (hit rate, +20.8pp delta, $21.47 saved) match `benchmark/baseline.json` within tolerance | ~15s | none |

## Why per-file pytest invocations?

The `run_tests_per_file.py` script doesn't run `pytest tests/` as one command —
it runs each file in its own subprocess. This is deliberate: several
integration tests construct multiple `MiniLMEmbedder` instances in one process,
which on Apple Silicon (MPS) occasionally deadlocks at `embeddings.cpu()`
under memory pressure. Running each test file in a fresh Python process gives
each one a clean MiniLM cold-start and avoids the deadlock.

Trade-off: every subprocess pays its own MiniLM cold-load cost (~30-40s on
M-series Macs, much less on CPU-only Linux runners). Wall-clock is longer
than a single pytest invocation. CI doesn't need this — it uses a single
pytest invocation on a clean Linux runner where MPS is irrelevant.

## When to use which

Picking by what you changed:

| If you changed... | Run |
|---|---|
| `sulci/` source code | `make test-per-file` |
| `examples/*.py` or `smoke_test*.py` | `make examples` |
| `examples/langchain_example.py` or `examples/llamaindex_example.py` (and you have API keys) | `make verify-integration-examples` |
| `benchmark/` files or anything that affects benchmark numbers | `make benchmark-verify` |
| Anything before opening a PR | `make checkin` |

## Output and logs

All three scripts save per-target log files to `/tmp/sulci-*-runner/`. On
failure, the summary table prints the path of the failing log so you can
inspect what actually went wrong rather than re-running with `-v`.

Override the log directory with `--log-dir <path>` on any script.

## Adding new scripts

If you add a new runner here:

1. Make it a `#!/usr/bin/env python3` script with `chmod +x`
2. Use `argparse` with a `--help` that explains preconditions and exit codes
3. Use `subprocess.run(timeout=...)` rather than the GNU `timeout` command
   (macOS doesn't ship `timeout` by default; `subprocess.run` is portable)
4. Save per-target logs to `/tmp/<runner-name>/` so failure diagnosis
   doesn't require re-running the whole sweep
5. Add a Makefile target so other contributors don't have to remember
   the exact invocation
6. Update this README with a new row in the "What's here" table
